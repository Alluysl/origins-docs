# Bi-Entity Conditions

Bi-entity Conditions operate on a `Pair<Entity, Entity>`, or in simpler terms: an actor and a target. The actor and target is determined depending on the used power type, and can be swapped. These are available to power types that provides a `bientity_condition` field, which restricts when a power is active.
