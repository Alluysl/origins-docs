# Bi-Entity Conditions

Bi-Entity Conditions operate in relation to two `LivingEntity`'s, an actor and a target. The actor and target are decided depending on the power type. Similar to entity conditions, these are available to be used in most powers in the `bientity_condition` field, which restricts when a power is active.
