# Target Action

[Meta Action](../bientity_actions.md).

Executes an entity action as the target of the action, simulating a regular entity action. This is mainly to be used when there is only a bientity action field.

Type ID: `origins:target_action`

### Fields

Field  | Type | Default | Description
-------|------|---------|-------------
`entity_action` | [Action](../entity_actions.md) | | The action which might be executed.

### Example

```json
"bientity_action": {
    "type": "origins:target_action",
    "entity_action": {
        "type": "origins:set_on_fire",
        "duration": 5
    }
}
```

This will set the target of the action on fire for 5 seconds.
