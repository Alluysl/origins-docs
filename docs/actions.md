# Biome Conditions

Actions are, along-side [Conditions](../conditions.md), Origins' way of serializing (= making data-driven) complex behavior (requires v0.4.1 and higher!). They are not used by any Origins in the default set, and are therefore not well tested or very exhaustive. However, they were implemented in order to better satisfy the requirements towards the data-driven system of the suggestions I've seen, thus may be quite useful for data pack creators.

They are grouped by the type of object they act on, such as entities, blocks or items:

## List

* [Entity Action](entity_actions)
* [Block Action](block_actions)
* [Item Action](item_actions)
* [Meta Actions](meta_actions) are actions that can be used in any other action type.
