# Damage Conditions

Damage Conditions operate on a combination of `DamageSource` and `Float`, allowing to check not only the type of damage dealt, but also how much damage was dealt.

## List

* [Amount](damage_conditions/amount.md)
* [Attacker](damage_conditions/attacker.md)
* [Fire](damage_conditions/fire.md)
* [Name](damage_conditions/name.md)
* [Projectile](damage_conditions/projectile.md)
